    "the available positions are 0 to (tf_seq_len-1). Which is why I subtracted 1 from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we must have the value of pt to be such that it represents the CENTER of the window.\n",
    "If pt is too close to 0, pt-D will be negative - a non-existent position.\n",
    "If pt is too close to tf_seq_len, pt+D will be a non-existent position.\n",

    "to the transform_out() function. That is, I am ignoring the last\n",

    "It's 'eos'. \n",
    "\n",
    "I trained it before without dynamically feeding the output_len.\n",
    "Ideally the network should determine the output_len by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is why I defined (in past) a MAX_LEN, and transformed target outputs in\n",
    "the form \"word1 word2 word3....eos <PAD> <PAD>....until max_length\"\n",
    "I created the model output in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model would ideally learn in which context and where to put eos.\n",

    "\n",
